# Stephen's Dotfiles

A collections of dotfiles, mostly for my own use.

## What's Here?

Configuration files for:

- Bash
- Vim
- Tmux
- Git
- Mercurial

...and one or two other things.

## Configuration

Not much on offer here.

- `.bash/internals`

  This lets you store internal configuration, be that corporate proxy
  configuration or something else entirely
